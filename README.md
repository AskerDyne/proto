# Proto

****

Proto is where we like to believe ideas take flight and concepts come to life. This repository is dedicated to acting as a sandbox playground for a collection of proof of concept (PoC) projects developed under the AskerDyne banner.

*With a sprinkling aid from others who rightfully get attribution and credit*!

The mission is simple; explore the cutting edge, push boundaries of what we know, and pave the way for groundbreaking innovations or OSS that go towards [AskerDyne Limited](https://askerdyne.com).

*Each prototype can be found within its own designated folder for management purposes*.
