## ðŸš€ About ProtoStation | [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/97707eea9255430ca830dc8e0f816539)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/FoxIDK/protostation/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

ProtoStation is where I'd like to believe my ideas take flight and concepts come to life. This repository is dedicated to hosting a collection of proof of concept (PoC) projects I've developed.

*With a sprinkling aid from others who rightfully get attribution and credit*!

The mission is simple; explore the cutting edge, push boundaries of what I know, and pave the way for groundbreaking innovations or OSS that go towards [FoxLabs](https://foxlabs.cloud).

*Each prototype can be found within its own designated folder for management purposes*.

## ðŸ•¸ Contributors
