## ðŸš€ About ProtoStation | [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/97707eea9255430ca830dc8e0f816539)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/FoxIDK/protostation/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

ProtoStation is where I'd like to believe my ideas take flight and concepts come to life. This repository is dedicated to hosting a collection of proof of concept (PoC) projects I've developed.

*With a sprinkling aid from others who rightfully get attribution and credit*!

The mission is simple; explore the cutting edge, push boundaries of what I know, and pave the way for groundbreaking innovations or OSS that go towards [FoxLabs](https://foxlabs.cloud).

*Each prototype can be found within its own designated folder for management purposes*.

## ðŸ¥‚ How To Contribute
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to the ProtoStation. Any contribution you make will be reflected in the Contributors segment prior to this.

To navigate the codebase and contribute with confidence:

- You must sign the commits or it **will* be rejected.
- The file hierarchy is cleanly `./project_name/project_name.py` an example being `./orbital_period/orbital_period.py`.
- If you need to use additional programs, ensure they're built around the `project_name.py` and contained to the folder it inhabits. You can find a good example of this in `codebreak_net` which contains two `.py` files and sub-folders.
- Study the pre-existing code style before contributing or it may get rejected or edited heavily. I'm trying to keep it uniform and consistent across the board and as I do welcome contributions I'd prefer it stays consistant. Code is often built in snippets, with a clear and short comment outlining the function of the snippet - it doesn't have to be complicated, less is more. Stick to DRY, KISS and YAGNI where possible. *Just follow the style, please*.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with a project in ProtoStation and a related issue doesn't already exist, you can open a new issue, give as much information as possible, but keep it clean and simple.

#### Solve an issue

If you scan through the current issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, I don't assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix and get added to the contributors list!

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create the directory for your project (*lower case using underscores for spaces*) and make the {project_name}.{extension} within that as explained earlier.

3. When you've finished make a pull request, but ensure you haven't overwritten someone elses work or made a conflict!

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
Once you submit your PR, either myself or a member of FoxLabs will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information or revisions to fit the coding style, for consistancy.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues. We're happy to work with you in resolving these problems.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations. Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible.
